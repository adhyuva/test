<!--first paragraph-->
<h2 class="rg" id="types">Bey types</h2>
<p class="p1">So there are four differnt sections of beyblade(like the show) Beyblade Burst, Beyblade Burst
    Eveloution,Beyblade Brust Trubo and finally Beybladebrust Rise(we will not talk about metal fusion) I know a lot of
    Eveloution Beys and some Turbo I don't know any thing about Beyblade burst Rise and alothough I have seen the show I
    have seen no Beyblade Brust beys in action in real life. <strong>Because truth is sometimes in the show they act
        good but they are not sometimes visa vesa and sometimes they are truthfully but only sometimes.</strong></p>
<p class="p2">There are four types of beys in each title like in Beyblade Burst Beyblade Burst Evelution and so on they
    are:<br> Attack <br>
    Stamina <br>
    Defense <br>
    Balence <br>
    <br>
    Attack circles the outer rim of they stadium or attacks. <br>It has an advantage over stamina types and a
    disadvantage on Defense<br>
    <br>
    Defense defends all the attacks.
    <br>Advantage on attack types disadvantage on stamina types<br>
    <br>
    Stamina beys can spin for a long time.<br> Advantage on defense types disadvantages on attack <br>
    <br>
    Balence has an equal amount in all of them <br>It as know advantages or disadvantes against other beys!

<!--then here is code for battles-->
<h2 class="rg" id="battles">Battles</h2>
<p class="p1"> When you battle you battle in a staduim like in the show. To see pics just type beyblade stadium pics and
    a lot of pics of stadiums should pop up.There are three ways to win against a oppent<br>
    The first is a survior finish that is when you spin longer than the othe bey.It is one pt.<br>
    The second is a ring out finish that is when you knock they other bey out of the stadiumor in the putts in the
    stadium. It is one pt.</p>
<p class="p2">The last is a burst finish it is when your bey goes into three parts (or two for Nightmare Lui≈Ñor) do not
    worry you can fix it but the first few times it might be hard. It is 2pts.
    <br>
    <br>
    Most matches go to 2pts but some go to three you can choose.
    <br>
    There are also battles like two against one.Or battle roalys they mostly go on till the last bey spinning wins.There
    are a ton of other ways to battle.You can see them on the show or maybe just ask a friend.
